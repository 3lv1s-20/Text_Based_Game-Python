To run this game you need to have two eternal modules for python. The keyboard module and colorama.
If you don't have them they need to be installed through the command propmt:

1) Go in your documents on your laptpop and locate youur python39, NOT python3.9 (or whatever version of python you have) folder
2) Go on scripts 
3) Copy the file path by right clicking on scripts in the adress bar and then on copy adress as text
4) Open your command prompt by searching "command prompt" in the windows search box.
5) Open the command prompt and type: "cd" and the press spacebar, now copy your python scripts adress by pressing CTRL + V and then enter
6) If done correctly the path the command prompt uses should have changed to your python scripts path, 
for example mine was: "C:\Users\elvis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts"
7) Now type "pip"
8)Wait for it to load
9) Now type "pip install keyboard"
If an error was given go to this website (https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) and dowload from here
by clicking on the green box in the top right
10) Try to type "pip install keyboard" again in the command prompt
11) Once you've installed the keyboard module type "pip install colorama"
12) Again if an error was given go here (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) and download colorama
13) Try to install colorama from command propmt again by typing "pip intall colorama"

Now you should be able to run the game.
